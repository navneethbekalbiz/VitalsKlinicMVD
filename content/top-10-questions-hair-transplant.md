When considering a **hair transplant**, it’s natural to feel both excited and uncertain. A successful procedure doesn’t just depend on the surgeon or technique—it begins with asking the right questions during your **hair transplant consultation**.

### **Top 10 Questions to Ask Your Surgeon**

1.  **Am I a good candidate for a hair transplant?**
    Not everyone is eligible. Factors like donor hair density, age, and type of hair loss matter.

2.  **Which technique do you recommend: FUE or FUT?**
    Understanding the difference between Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) is crucial. FUE is generally preferred for its minimal scarring.

3.  **How much experience does the surgeon have?**
    Always ask about the surgeon's qualifications and the number of successful procedures they have performed.

4.  **Can I see before and after photos of previous patients?**
    Real results speak louder than promises. Look for consistency in the results.

5.  **What is the estimated cost?**
    Get a clear breakdown of the costs involved, including post-op care.

6.  **What is the recovery time?**
    Knowing when you can return to work or exercise is important for planning.

7.  **Will I need more than one session?**
    Depending on the extent of hair loss, you might need a follow-up session for density.

8.  **What are the potential risks and complications?**
    Every surgical procedure carries some risk. Ensure your surgeon explains them clearly.

9.  **What happens if I'm not satisfied with the results?**
    Ask about the clinic's revision policy.

10. **How do I maintain the transplanted hair?**
    Post-transplant care is vital for the longevity of your results.
