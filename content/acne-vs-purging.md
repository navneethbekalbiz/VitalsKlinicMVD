You just started a new skincare routine and suddenly your face is breaking out. Panic sets in. Is this normal? Is your skin reacting or rejecting the product? Understanding the difference between **acne vs purging** can save your skin and your sanity.

In this detailed guide, we’ll break down the major distinctions, explore **purging vs breakout differences**, and provide practical solutions so you don’t throw away a potentially great product or delay proper treatment.

### **What is Acne?**

Acne is a **chronic inflammatory condition** that affects millions worldwide. It results from clogged pores, excess oil production, bacteria, and often hormonal imbalances. Acne isn’t just a teenage problem; adults struggle with it too.

#### **Causes of Acne**
Acne is caused by several factors working together. These include overactive sebaceous (oil) glands, a buildup of dead skin cells, hormonal fluctuations (especially in women during menstrual cycles), and bacterial overgrowth — particularly *Propionibacterium acnes*. Stress, poor diet, and using comedogenic (pore-clogging) products can make it worse.

### **What is Skin Purging?**
Skin purging refers to a reaction to an active ingredient that increases skin cell turnover rate. As skin turnover speeds up, the skin starts shedding dead skin cells faster than normal. This brings pre-existing microcomedones (clogged pores) to the surface, manifesting as whiteheads, blackheads, or pustules.

#### **Key Differences**

| Feature | Acne Breakout | Skin Purging |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Can happen anywhere, often in new areas | Usually occurs where you normally break out |
| **Duration** | Can last for weeks or months if untreated | Temporary, typically clears up in 4-6 weeks |
| **Cause** | Clogged pores, bacteria, hormones | Active ingredients (Retinoids, AHAs/BHAs) |
| **Appearance** | Papules, pustules, cysts | Whiteheads, blackheads, small bumps |

### **Should You Stop Using the Product?**

If you are **purging**, the answer is generally **NO**. Consistency is key. Your skin is getting rid of impurities. However, if you are experiencing a reactive breakout or irritation (redness, burning), you should stop immediately.

If you are unsure, consult a dermatologist at **Vitals Klinic** to analyze your skin barrier and recommend the right course of action.
